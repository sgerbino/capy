/** A pool of threads for executing work concurrently.

    Use this when you need to run coroutines on multiple threads
    without the overhead of creating and destroying threads for
    each task. Work items are distributed across the pool using
    a shared queue.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.
    Shared objects: Unsafe.

    @par Example
    @code
    thread_pool pool(4);  // 4 worker threads
    auto ex = pool.get_executor();
    ex.post(some_coroutine);
    // pool destructor waits for all work to complete

        @ref executor_type::on_work_started and
        @ref executor_type::on_work_finished completes. After all

        complete. Worker threads finish their current item and
        exit; `join()` still waits for all threads to be joined

        join; subsequent calls return immediately.
